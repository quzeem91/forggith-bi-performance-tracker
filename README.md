# ðŸ“Š Forggith BI Performance Tracker


# Project Background
Forggith, a German-based pharmaceutical company operating on a B2B model, manufactures drugs distributed to consumers through their network of distributors. The company possesses a substantial dataset encompassing sales, targets, product type, distribution channel, and distributor information spanning four years.

This project undertakes a thorough analysis and synthesis of their data to develop Power BI reports, as per their requirements, aimed at informing their strategic, tactical, and operational decision-making.

Insights and recommendations are provided in the following key areas:

- **Sales Rep and Team Performance:** Evaluate the performance of individual sales reps and teams, focusing on achieved revenue, volume, and progress toward targets.

- **Product Class Contribution:** Analyze revenue and volume contributions from different product classes to identify key sales drivers and areas for strategic focus.

- **Distributor and Channels Contribution:** Analyze revenue and volume contributions by distributors and their respective channels across the years.

- **Revenue vs. Target Trends Over Time:** Track trends comparing actual revenue to targets over time, identifying performance patterns and seasonal variations for strategy adjustments.

## Data Structure and Modeling

From the datasets provided, the **Sales** fact table contains **213,598 rows** spanning four years of transactions (2022â€“2025). A **multi-fact table modeling approach** was used due to differences in granularity between the Sales and Target datasets.
Below is a snapshot of the data model created:

<details>
<summary>Why a multi-fact table approach was used</summary>

The Sales data is at the transaction level, while the Target data is aggregated by month, product, and sales rep. Directly linking these two would create granularity conflicts and incorrect aggregations. By modeling them as separate fact tables connected to shared dimensions, we maintain data integrity while enabling accurate comparisons and metrics.
</details>

Before building the model, several data transformation steps were carried out using **Power Query**, including:

- Cleaning and standardizing field entries  
- Merging the 2023â€“2025 sales data with the 2022 records  
- Unpivoting the yearly columns in the Target dataset to match the Sales structure  

These steps ensured consistency and compatibility across all datasets used in the reporting model.

<details>
<summary>View Power Query M scripts used for data cleaning</summary>

The cleaning process involved:
- Removing nulls and inconsistent entries  
- Normalizing column headers  
- Converting data types appropriately  
- Merging and appending sales tables across years  
- Unpivoting the target values across years into a single â€˜Yearâ€™ column

You can find the complete M script in the Power BI file's `Transform Data` section.

The final data model includes two fact tables â€” **Sales** and **Target** â€” connected to shared dimension tables:

- `DimProduct`  
- `DimEmployee`  
- `DimLocation`  
- `DimChannel`  
- A generated `Calendar` table for time intelligence

## ðŸ“Š Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Forggith Pharmaceuticals experienced steady revenue growth from 2022 through 2024, peaking at **$2.93 billion**, before encountering a slight contraction in 2025, with revenue declining to **$2.66 billion**. Despite this dip, each year recorded revenue above target, although **target achievement fell from 141.8% in 2022 to 109.7% in 2025**, signaling a deceleration in growth momentum.

During the same period, **sales volume declined year-over-year**, from **56,486 units in 2022 to 51,193 units in 2025**, alongside a drop in the number of active distributors from **14 to just 7**. This significant shrinking of the distribution footprint negatively impacted sales volume and revenue by 2025.
